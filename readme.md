<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Testing multiple input and output models in keras


Small test cases for testing neural networks for predictions with categorical
feature and label data. 

Also exploring multi loss models trained with data with sparsely populated 
categorical labels. 

## Use cases tested
* Combinations of
    + Encoded/Categorical inputs
    + Vectorised inputs
* Multiple outputs
* Custom losses for multiple losses
+ Masked and wegighted multiple losses

### Built With

* Tensorflow
* Keras
